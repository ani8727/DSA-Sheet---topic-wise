# Binary Search Series

This series of problems focuses on the binary search algorithm, a fundamental technique used to efficiently locate an element in a sorted array or to find specific conditions in a search space. Each problem builds upon the concepts of binary search, exploring various applications and variations of the algorithm.

## Problems Included

1. **Basic Binary Search (L-704)**: we have two variations of this problem:
   - Iterative Approach: while(low <= high)
   - Recursive Approach: if(low > high) return -1

2. **First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array**: Find the first and last

3. **Lower and Upper Bound**: Find the lower and upper bounds of a given number in a sorted array

4. **Search Insert Position (L:35)**: Determine the index at which a target value should be inserted in a sorted array - lower_bound problem

5. **Floor/Ceil in Sorted Array**: Find the floor (equal if not then less) and ceiling (equal if not then greater) values of a given number in a sorted array

6.**FirstlastPosition.cpp(L:34)**: Find the first and last position of an element in a sorted array using binary search.

7.**Count Occurrences of an Element in a Sorted Array**: Count how many times a given element appears in a sorted array using binary search - lower_bound and upper_bound functions  or lastPosition - firstPosition;

8.**Search in Rotated Sorted Array (L:33)**: Search for a target value in a rotated sorted array using modified binary search - pivot element, if-else.

9.**Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (L:153)**: Find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array using binary search- pivot element.

10.**TimeRotatedSorted.cpp**: Find the number of times a sorted array has been rotated using binary search - pivot element.

11.**Search in Rotated Sorted Array II (L:81)**: Search for a target value in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates using modified binary search - pivot element, if-else.

12.**Peak Element (L:162)**: Find a peak element in an array using binary search - if-else.

13.**sqrt(x) (L:69)**: Compute the integer square root of a non-negative integer using binary search - mid*mid == x, mid*mid < x, mid*mid > x.
