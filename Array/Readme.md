# Array Problems Series

## Problem Included  

## *Easy Problems*  

1. **Largest Element in an Array**: Find the largest element in an array by iterating through all elements and keeping track of the maximum value found.

2. **Second Largest/Smallest Element in an Array**: Identify the second largest element by maintaining two variables to track the largest and second largest values while iterating through the array.

3. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array[L-26]**: Traverse the sorted array and use a pointer to keep track of the position of unique elements, effectively removing duplicates in-place.

4. **Max Consecutive Ones[L-485]**: Count the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array by iterating through the array and maintaining a count of consecutive 1s.

5. **Left Rotate Array[L-189]**: Rotate an array to the left by a given number of positions using a temporary array to store the first 'd' elements and then shifting the remaining elements.

6. **Right Rotate Array[L-189]**: Rotate an array to the right by a given number of positions using a temporary array to store the last 'd' elements and then shifting the remaining elements.

7. **Missing Number[L-268]**: Find the missing number in an array containing n distinct numbers taken from the range [0, n] using the sum formula or XOR operation.

8. **Single Number[L-136]**: Identify the single number in an array where every other number appears twice by using the XOR operation to cancel out duplicate numbers.

9. **Move Zeroes[L-283]**: Move all zeroes in an array to the end while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements by using a two-pointer approach.

10. **Find Union of Two Sorted Arrays**: Merge two sorted arrays and eliminate duplicates to find the union of the two arrays.

11. **Two Sum[L-1]**: Find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target using a hash map to store the complement of each number.

12. **Two Sum Sorted Array[Leetcode-167]**: Find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target using the two-pointer technique.

13. **Search In Matrix[L-74]**: Search for a target value in a 2D matrix by treating the matrix as a flattened sorted array and applying binary search.

## *Medium Problems*

1. **Leader in an Array**: Identify all leaders in an array, where a leader is defined as an element that is greater than all elements to its right.

2. **Spinal Matrix Print**: Print the elements of a matrix in a spiral order by maintaining boundaries for rows and columns and iteratively traversing the matrix.

3. **Rotate Matrix by 90 Degree**: Rotate a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise by first transposing the matrix and then reversing each row.
