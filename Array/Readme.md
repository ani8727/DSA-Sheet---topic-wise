# Array Problems Series

## Problem Included  

## *Easy Problems*  

1. **Largest Element in an Array**: Find the largest element in an array by iterating through all elements and keeping track of the maximum value found.

2. **Second Largest/Smallest Element in an Array**: Identify the second largest element by maintaining two variables to track the largest and second largest values while iterating through the array.

3. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array[L-26]**: Traverse the sorted array and use a pointer to keep track of the position of unique elements, effectively removing duplicates in-place.

4. **Max Consecutive Ones[L-485]**: Count the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array by iterating through the array and maintaining a count of consecutive 1s.

5. **Left Rotate Array[L-189]**: Rotate an array to the left by a given number of positions using a temporary array to store the first 'd' elements and then shifting the remaining elements.

6. **Right Rotate Array[L-189]**: Rotate an array to the right by a given number of positions using a temporary array to store the last 'd' elements and then shifting the remaining elements.

7. **Missing Number[L-268]**: Find the missing number in an array containing n distinct numbers taken from the range [0, n] using the sum formula or XOR operation.
